# SARLS
SARLS (Simple Auto Restart for Linux Service)

This script is created by Khairil Gunawan to make my work more simple to monitor linux service will automatically restarted if the service is stopped

How to use:
```sh
$ wget tiny.cc/sarls
$ #or curl -LO sarls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/khairilg/SARLS/master/sarls
$ sh sarls
$ Enter linux service name to monitor: <enter linux service name here>
$ Enter notification if the service is stopped (example: not running): <enter service notification>
```
  
  *Done*
